			<h2>1960 - Jacques Plante</h2>
		<p>The first goalie mask ever worn in the NHL was a fibreglass mask worn by a goaltender by the name of Jaques Plante in 1959. Jaques wore the mask for the first time after taking a shot to the face in a hockey game and was the first goalie to wear a mask regularly. The mask itself didn’t have much padding and was a hard shell that wrapped around the goalies face, it wasn’t much but it was much better than having nothing on. This kind of mask was worn mostly throughout the 60s and wasn’t the norm as other goalies still elected not to wear it. Fibre glass is a kind of hard plastic threaded with glass shards throughout the build.</p>

			<h2>1970 - Ernest Higgins</h2>
			<p>Ernest Higgins was the creator of these masks that eventually spread throughout the NHL and were worn by many goalies in the 70s. The mask itself was still made of a similar fibreglass material however there was much more foam padding than the previous masks. The padding helped a lot as they’d absorb the shock of the puck when it hit the mask. These masks would pave the way for more padding and extra protection that would be soon to come later on.</p>

			<h2>1980 - Michel Dion</h2>
			<p>Michel Dion played for the Pittsburgh penguins and was the first goalie to wear a mask with any sort of neck protection. Not too many goalies were playing with this style of mask but it is very apparent that this style was a stepping stone for the helmets used in todays game. The protection came in the form of this “Duck bill” sort of design that came off the helmet and extended down towards the chest to protect the neck from any pucks that would be flying towards the goal.</p>

			<h2>1990 - Standard Mask</h2>
			<p>In the 90s the Goalie “mask” evolved into a sort of goalie “helmet” which would be the general style and idea even till today. These new revolutionary masks were still made of fibreglass but there was a new way that these were built with regards to the vision of the mask. These helmets had a cage on the front that were attached to the fibreglass shell, the shell wrapped around the head and the interior was padded with foam. At this point in the NHL everyone was wearing helmets including all the players.</p>

			<h2>2000 - Standard Mask w/ Neck Gaurd</h2>
			<p>2000s and onward kept this similar cage/ fibreglass helmet but manufacturers also tried a different method in which they’d also use carbon fibre, we also saw the dangling neck guard become a reoccurring thing for added neck protection. On top of the added material the interior started adding more padding as well.</p>

			<h2>2010 - Standard Mask Today</h2>
			<p>2010s up till now have a slightly different design, the bottom of the mask is a lot longer to protect the neck and there are more ingredients put into it such as Kevlar, carbon fibre, and nylon resin all coming together to provide the best protection possible, some of this material is used even in bullet proof vests so you know that it is very sturdy and can help a lot when protecting the head against the pucks.</p>
